Many qualities make a fine horse—the strength of rippling muscles, the beauty of quiet eyes, the heavy elegance of its lumbering walk, and the certainty of knowing it won’t stab you in the back.

Hal wiped the sweat off his brow and held his whip high. An undisciplined horse ran laps in the circular paddock, shying away from him each time it passed. The young man coughed dryly through the swirling dust.

_Crack._ The whip snapped harmlessly overhead as Hal exerted an invisible thread of control over the animal. The horse tried to spin around, but Hal yanked on that thread, its tautness maintained with the force of his will and each intentional snap of the whip. Horses held no hidden guile, and he read its intention to rebel and dart in the other direction just in time. _Crack._ It was only once the horse began to follow his lead without hesitation that Hal finally lowered his arm. He snatched his faded shirt off the rail and tugged it on.

A cart loaded with hay rolled to a stop outside the corral. Shams sat atop it, squinting.
Hal sighed but cornered the horse and grabbed it by the halter. Giving it a handful of oats and a few encouraging words, he released it into the field. Resigned, he turned toward the grizzled farmhand.

“Let’s go.” Shams tapped the side of the cart impatiently. A shadow of deja-vu passed over Hal. He could rarely avoid Shams and allow himself the pleasure of walking home alone. His older coworker always stopped to pick him up as the work day ended. And he always got in the wagon.

“You don’t have to drive me home,” he said, climbing up.

“It’s no trouble. A moment to let the horse rest.” Shams huffed. Tension began to bleed from Hal’s shoulders, and he drank deeply from the water pouch on his hip.

“I certainly hope there’s no trouble.”

The too-cool voice snapped him back into stiff alertness. Jer, the farmhand with a nose and hand in everything he could, wearing that irritating smile and a straight-cut vest that was always too clean at the end of the day, stepped out of the shadow of the barn, beaming at them through crooked teeth. Fake.

Jer casually gripped their horse’s bridle and gave the animal a disinterested pat. Shams lowered the reins. Against the cowering stone wall to their left, a few other farmhands leaned back, brushing off dirt from their leathers. One of them, a bright-eyed new hire,—_Petens? Peters?_—glanced around with uncertainty at the strange gathering. That morning, Hal had coolly declined his invitation to join up for drinks after work. The new hire was welcome to keep such company on his own if he could stomach it.

“Go enjoy a drink, Jer.” Hal narrowed his eyes. “Shams’ hay’s needed back at the house.”

“We won’t take up much of your time. We’re giving the newbie a tour and sharing the usual newcomer advice, warnings...”

Shams spat off the cart onto the ground. “Hell.”

No other commentary was necessary.

“A couple of last notes for you, newbie,” Jer swaggered up to the cart, “Shams here is only employed out of the boss’ sense of charity. He’s not a senior to look up to.” He seized Shams by the front of his shirt and jerked him sideways off the cart, sending the old man to his knees. “Don’t let him put on airs and order you around as he tends to.”

The newbie swallowed, his eyes searching the group. The other men murmured; some turned their heads away—the general attitude passivity and even vague approval. Hal clenched his hands but kept them in his pockets.

Shams could stand up for himself if need be. Hal’s association with the old man was characterized by an unspoken agreement to keep personal matters personal. The sun sank lower over the road.

_Slap._ A grunt of stifled pain drew Hal's eyes inadvertently toward the group. Jer kicked the old man squarely in the thighs. Another farmhand shoved at Shams’ shoulders, but the old man made no further sound and only raised his hands to cover his head.

Something pinched in Hal’s chest. Dropping off the cart, his boots landed on packed earth. He honed in on a leering face; his fist connected with a lean jaw. _Crack_. A hush fell over the group, and Jer staggered back.

A wiry body rushed at him. Hal sidestepped and with the force of his momentum twisted the attacker’s thin arm aside. He kicked the legs out from under the hapless farmhand and braced himself for the next.

Wariness spread on their faces as they circled him slowly. They had reason to be careful. It would be easy to disable each of them, even outnumbered like this. One had a weak ankle, evidenced by a slight limp, an excellent spot to focus a disabling kick. That one had a knife on his belt, ripe for the picking. Their efforts were uncoordinated; they were untrained to distinguish a proper opening from a feint. He sprang into the pleasant flex and stretch of drowsy muscles.

“Are you pretending to be friends with the geezer now?” Jer’s words jarred him out of his adrenaline-fueled focus.

_Friends? No._ Hal straightened slowly. On the ground, several bodies lay doubled over and groaning. A hostile circle around him continued to tighten.

“Go get your drinks,” he said wearily. At least they’d backed away from Shams. A coworker yanked his arms back into a pinch and braced a sweaty body against his back.

"Gladly," Jer sneered at him through crooked teeth, "and let's all agree to put this behind us, shall we? A peep from you to the boss and we'll thrash shitty Shams within an inch of his life. Then it'll be your turn."

Hal met the mocking gaze with stone-cold apathy. A single punch collided squarely with his nose. The weight behind him disappeared as he lurched back from the blow and fell to the ground. Jerked upwards again by his collar, he blinked back emotionless tears from the smarting pain.

“Haughty Hal. Keep looking down at us if you can.” Jer was just a shadow against the sky.
Hal couldn’t restrain a smirk.

“You want to get beaten up,” Jer scoffed in disbelief and spat in his face, but Hal chuckled even as he choked in a tightening grip. He braced himself for an onslaught of retaliation, but Jer shoved him to the ground.

Disappointment displaced the adrenaline flooding his body, and Hal sat back in the dirt, letting his head drop. He held up his sleeve to catch the blood flow from his nose. The sounds of the men muttering and kicking up dust faded as they moved toward the road. He exhaled heavily through pursed lips, disgusted.

Shams broke the silence. “Should’na done that for me.”

Hal rose to his feet with a hoarse laugh. “For you? I just wanted to break Jer’s nose.” He nonchalantly wiped his sleeve across his face. Upon closer inspection, Shams seemed fine beyond some bruises and a few scrapes, but those aged shoulders sagged heavily.
They climbed back into the cart and, with a flick of the reins, drove forward.

“Boss won't stand for this,” Shams said.

“Hmm.” Hal closed his eyes. The blood splashed across his lips glued his mouth shut.

The cart jerked as they entered the city through the west gate, and Hal peeked open one eye disinterestedly at the homes and towers passing by. Long ago carved with painstaking care into the stone blocks, the magical runes of protection and prosperity were weary and subdued in the daylight. Though they would glow when darkness fell, their presence was overpowered by the last sunlight reflecting harshly off the tips of cold roofs leaning oppressively over the road. This so-called romantic city that was Saidorn was a facade. People passed each other by without acknowledgment, faces drawn, caught up in their own concerns.

They stopped at a fountain and washed themselves clean of blood and dirt. It was still under his nails, and he grimaced, but he could hide them in his pockets. They drove on and rolled under a high stone arch into a quiet courtyard. A sprawling two-story building crumbling under a thick spread of vines, the Lang house sheltered not only the boss and his daughter but also the servants and many of the farm staff. Swallows darted in and out of nests that clung beneath the eaves, and buzzing flickers of color, hummingbirds and bees, darted around window boxes bursting with marigolds, zinnias, and trailing begonias. Hal inhaled deeply, though the fair scent was masked somewhat by the lingering, metallic odor of blood.

Shams began unloading the wagon. Damaris straightened up from a bed of blue irises skirting the veranda. The young woman’s self-assured expression dropped into a slight frown and she approached with one delicate hand holding the hem of her skirt off the ground. “What happened to you, Hal?”

A corner of Hal’s mouth pulled upward into a rueful smile. “Good evening, ma’am. Naught to worry about. Animals were a little wild today.” _Not a lie_, he sneered internally.

Her face was neutral; who knew what she thought of his words? As the boss’ daughter, Damaris was an unapproachable enigma. He rarely interacted with her directly, though he had witnessed her firmness in managing the household servants several times. She perhaps had a more playful side: when she went on weekly rides with her fiancé, her bright laughter could be heard from any side of the Lang house. But that was none of his business.

“Take care of yourself and put a poultice on it before you rest. Any of the chefs can give you one.”

“Yes, ma’am.” He turned away from her unwavering blue eyes to the weeds and bits of dirt caught up in her apron.

“By the way," she continued without retreating. "Though it is never easy for me to bring criticism to others' attention, are you aware that there seems to be a consensus that you aren’t easy to work with?”

Hal let out a short laugh before he could stop himself, sobering as a dull pain spread across his face. “Sorry, ma’am.”

No specific excuse came to mind. Grub like Jer and his buddies came out of the farm’s woodwork as soon as the boss was away on business. How many of the other coworkers were of similar ilk? Hal pulled his own weight. That was enough.

The young woman clicked her tongue softly. “You’ve been here three months, and your horses have performed excellently without fail, so please don’t take this the wrong way. My father is pleased with your work so far, but when the foaling season hits, you’ll need to work closely with others. I suggest you expend a little effort in making friends rather than enemies. Father is quite particular about who he chooses to keep on and who he lets go.” Damaris glanced at Shams, who continued forking hay into the shed with his back to them.

“I’ll keep that in mind, ma’am,” Hal answered quickly, a trace of a frown furrowing his brows. _That was a threat._ His stomach twisted.

Damaris' tone lightened as a fresh smile broke on her face. “Now set work aside. We labor to live and not vice versa. My fiancé will be visiting tomorrow evening for dinner. You will join us.” She leaned back on one hip. “As a chaperone, but I should think you'll get along with the party quite well. It will be delightful weather for eating out of doors.”

“Ma'am?” Hal blinked. _Party?_ “With all due respect, ma'am, your fiancé—” _is the crown prince of Latar_. Hal’s cheeks began to burn. The couple was casual and unassuming, enjoying each other's company as they interacted with the servants in a friendly manner. He wouldn’t have known that her suitor was the prince at all if he hadn’t overheard someone mention it. Their behavior was too friendly. It made him ill. Just thinking about it, he felt a sharp pain behind his temples, the beginnings of a migraine.

“I’ll need a chaperone from my household to accompany me, why not you?” She turned away with a smile. “Five o'clock tomorrow. We’ll meet on the veranda.”

Damaris had so quickly shifted between expressing concern, critique, and cheer that Hal stood momentarily bewildered, watching her stride back to the house. She just threatened his job and then invited him to a party? Irritation displaced his confusion. Why did people constantly hide their ulterior motives behind friendly masks? He actually preferred the open hostility of certain farmhands. Their hostility was honest, at least.

Coming out of a daze, Hal heard a ‘hmph’ behind him. He turned in time to see Shams shake his head before walking away with the empty cart. The day’s exhaustion suddenly hit him; a herd of horses stomped around in his skull. Walking across the courtyard back to the Lang house, he slipped in through the creaking servant door. The low-ceilinged entryway welcomed his boots, and he passed into a dark kitchen. A faint lingering scent of ham remained in the air from dinner, blending with a leafy tea smell that soothed his buzzing mind.

And there was that cute girl, as warm to the touch as the bread she baked each morning—Terien. The chef’s assistant had her sleeves rolled up, arms elbow-deep in shiny suds as she washed up from dinner. Weariness forgotten, Hal slipped behind her, pinched her belly through her apron, and backed up as she let out a stifled squeal.

He sat at the counter across from her and leaned forward with a grin. "Good evening, miss."

“Hal!” The woman scrunched her forehead. She flipped back dark hair from her shoulders. “Huh. What happened to you?” The concern on Terien's face was soft, reminiscent of Mother patching up his knee after a scuffle with the village boys. A flush of discomfort rose in his chest.

“I—nothing.” Hal shrugged. He ran his fingers along the counter's smooth surface with his eyes on her collarbone.

“I hope it wasn’t a fight.” She murmured, biting her lip and drawing his attention upwards.

“It’s nothing,” he repeated and straightened. "How's your mom?"

"Better today. She remembered my name. And she appreciated your flowers."

Hal just nodded shortly. Terien’s back turned as she dug about in some bins. “I overheard the butler talking to the madam about you today.”

A thread of irritation ran through him. “People talk a lot.”

“He brought a letter from the master. Surely it can’t be good for a letter to mention you by name? Goodness. You really don’t look well.”

He ran a hand over his forehead to wipe away a sudden sweat and looked at her naive button nose with a grimace.

Please don’t pick any more fights,” she said.

Hal averted his gaze from the confusing mix of emotions on Terien’s face. Her hands tightened around the poultice that she held out for him to take.

“I don’t pick them.” He snatched the poultice and held it against his nose. A scent of sage, tinged by a sharp undertone of vinegar, brought the headache back. “And I don’t need your gossip or your opinions. Are you my wife?”

A mug of ale and a plate of food slammed onto the counter in front of him. “Are you a boor? Eat this and shove off.”

Her skirts swished furiously away into the pantry, and Hal sighed, vaguely relieved. He dined, at first, in blissful solitude. But silence lent itself too well to unwelcome thoughts. Damaris’ warning and a letter from the master pointed all too clearly toward an early termination. He scoffed, pushing around a pile of mashed potatoes.

Regarding the outlook with indifference turned out to be impossible. Talfryn's wrinkled face in his mind's eye summoned a childlike shame in his gut. That stubborn physician, responsible for his taking this job in the first place, already put unrealistic stock in Hal's abilities. The man oughtn't to be surprised if his student returned in less than a year. Right about now, that ridiculous character would be sitting on a chair beneath the flowering apples, waiting for the stars to come out. Hal pushed away a half empty plate. _Someone better take care the old coot doesn't sleep outside._

He retreated down a narrow hallway, quietly entered his room, and locked the door. The interior was small and rather bare. Though he had lodged in the Lang house for three months, his items were still packed in saddle bags in one corner. The stone shelves above his neatly made bed were dusty and unused.

Eyeing his forlorn belongings, Hal imagined throwing them on the back of a horse and riding off, wind in his hair. Instead, he tossed himself onto the bed. Heaviness gripped his limbs as though he were settling into the earth, or a coffin.

---

A dull thud of hooves echoed through Hal’s mind. He found himself crawling on all fours up a hill. Struggling to progress through thick fog, he moved forward doggedly. His nose seemed to be bleeding again, and dark blood splattered onto the ground. He urgently needed to find someone. _Who?_

His sleeve caught on the stones and he looked down. A knife in his hand gleamed with fresh blood. _When did I--?_ Panicking, he tossed it aside and continued to climb. As the ground began to level out, he started pulling himself upright but stopped on one knee as if frozen. In front of him was a body, its face disfigured by slashes, only a single glassy eye staring directly at him.
