			<h1 id="page-title">1 Acedia</h1>
			<p id="page-content">
				Many qualities make a fine horse—the strength of rippling muscles, the
				beauty of quiet eyes, the heavy elegance of its lumbering walk, and the
				certainty of knowing it won’t stab you in the back.
			</p>
			<p id="page-content">
				Hal wiped the sweat off his brow and held his whip high. An
				undisciplined horse ran laps in the circular paddock, shying away from
				him each time it passed. The young man coughed dryly through the
				swirling dust.
			</p>
			<p id="page-content">
				<em>Crack.</em> The whip snapped harmlessly overhead as Hal exerted an
				invisible thread of control over the animal. The horse tried to spin
				around, but Hal yanked on that thread, its tautness maintained with the
				force of his will and each intentional snap of the whip. Horses held no
				hidden guile, and he read its intention to rebel and dart in the other
				direction just in time. <em>Crack.</em> It was only once the horse began
				to follow his lead without hesitation that Hal finally lowered his arm.
				He snatched his faded shirt off the rail and tugged it on.
			</p>
			<p id="page-content">
				A cart loaded with hay rolled to a stop outside the corral. Shams sat
				atop it, squinting. Hal sighed but cornered the horse and grabbed it by
				the halter. Giving it a handful of oats and a few encouraging words, he
				released it into the field. Resigned, he turned toward the grizzled
				farmhand.
			</p>
			<p id="page-content">
				“Let’s go.” Shams tapped the side of the cart impatiently. A shadow of
				deja-vu passed over Hal. He could rarely avoid Shams and allow himself
				the pleasure of walking home alone. His older coworker always stopped to
				pick him up as the work day ended. And he always got in the wagon.
			</p>
			<p id="page-content">
				“You don’t have to drive me home,” he said, climbing up.
			</p>
			<p id="page-content">
				“It’s no trouble. A moment to let the horse rest.” Shams huffed. Tension
				began to bleed from Hal’s shoulders, and he drank deeply from the water
				pouch on his hip.
			</p>
			<p id="page-content">“I certainly hope there’s no trouble.”</p>
			<p id="page-content">
				The too-cool voice snapped him back into stiff alertness. Jer, the
				farmhand with a nose and hand in everything he could, wearing that
				irritating smile and a straight-cut vest that was always too clean at
				the end of the day, stepped out of the shadow of the barn, beaming at
				them through crooked teeth. Fake.
			</p>
			<p id="page-content">
				Jer casually gripped their horse’s bridle and gave the animal a
				disinterested pat. Shams lowered the reins. Against the cowering stone
				wall to their left, a few other farmhands leaned back, brushing off dirt
				from their leathers. One of them, a bright-eyed new hire,—*Petens?
				Peters?*—glanced around with uncertainty at the strange gathering. That
				morning, Hal had coolly declined his invitation to join up for drinks
				after work. The new hire was welcome to keep such company on his own if
				he could stomach it.
			</p>
			<p id="page-content">
				“Go enjoy a drink, Jer.” Hal narrowed his eyes. “Shams’ hay’s needed
				back at the house.”
			</p>
			<p id="page-content">
				“We won’t take up much of your time. We’re giving the newbie a tour and
				sharing the usual newcomer advice, warnings...”
			</p>
			<p id="page-content">Shams spat off the cart onto the ground. “Hell.”</p>
			<p id="page-content">No other commentary was necessary.</p>
			<p id="page-content">
				“A couple of last notes for you, newbie,” Jer swaggered up to the cart,
				“Shams here is only employed out of the boss’ sense of charity. He’s not
				a senior to look up to.” He seized Shams by the front of his shirt and
				jerked him sideways off the cart, sending the old man to his knees.
				“Don’t let him put on airs and order you around as he tends to.”
			</p>
			<p id="page-content">
				The newbie swallowed, his eyes searching the group. The other men
				murmured; some turned their heads away—the general attitude passivity
				and even vague approval. Hal clenched his hands but kept them in his
				pockets.
			</p>
			<p id="page-content">
				Shams could stand up for himself if need be. Hal’s association with the
				old man was characterized by an unspoken agreement to keep personal
				matters personal. The sun sank lower over the road.
			</p>
			<p id="page-content">
				<em>Slap.</em> A grunt of stifled pain drew Hal's eyes inadvertently
				toward the group. Jer kicked the old man squarely in the thighs. Another
				farmhand shoved at Shams’ shoulders, but the old man made no further
				sound and only raised his hands to cover his head.
			</p>
			<p id="page-content">
				Something pinched in Hal’s chest. Dropping off the cart, his boots
				landed on packed earth. He honed in on a leering face; his fist
				connected with a lean jaw. <em>Crack</em>. A hush fell over the group,
				and Jer staggered back.
			</p>
			<p id="page-content">
				A wiry body rushed at him. Hal sidestepped and with the force of his
				momentum twisted the attacker’s thin arm aside. He kicked the legs out
				from under the hapless farmhand and braced himself for the next.
			</p>
			<p id="page-content">
				Wariness spread on their faces as they circled him slowly. They had
				reason to be careful. It would be easy to disable each of them, even
				outnumbered like this. One had a weak ankle, evidenced by a slight limp,
				an excellent spot to focus a disabling kick. That one had a knife on his
				belt, ripe for the picking. Their efforts were uncoordinated; they were
				untrained to distinguish a proper opening from a feint. He sprang into
				the pleasant flex and stretch of drowsy muscles.
			</p>
			<p id="page-content">
				“Are you pretending to be friends with the geezer now?” Jer’s words
				jarred him out of his adrenaline-fueled focus.
			</p>
			<p id="page-content">
				<em>Friends? No.</em> Hal straightened slowly. On the ground, several
				bodies lay doubled over and groaning. A hostile circle around him
				continued to tighten.
			</p>
			<p id="page-content">
				“Go get your drinks,” he said wearily. At least they’d backed away from
				Shams. A coworker yanked his arms back into a pinch and braced a sweaty
				body against his back.
			</p>
			<p id="page-content">
				"Gladly," Jer sneered at him through crooked teeth, "and let's all agree
				to put this behind us, shall we? A peep from you to the boss and we'll
				thrash shitty Shams within an inch of his life. Then it'll be your
				turn."
			</p>
			<p id="page-content">
				Hal met the mocking gaze with stone-cold apathy. A single punch collided
				squarely with his nose. The weight behind him disappeared as he lurched
				back from the blow and fell to the ground. Jerked upwards again by his
				collar, he blinked back emotionless tears from the smarting pain.
			</p>
			<p id="page-content">
				“Haughty Hal. Keep looking down at us if you can.” Jer was just a shadow
				against the sky. Hal couldn’t restrain a smirk.
			</p>
			<p id="page-content">
				“You want to get beaten up,” Jer scoffed in disbelief and spat in his
				face, but Hal chuckled even as he choked in a tightening grip. He braced
				himself for an onslaught of retaliation, but Jer shoved him to the
				ground.
			</p>
			<p id="page-content">
				Disappointment displaced the adrenaline flooding his body, and Hal sat
				back in the dirt, letting his head drop. He held up his sleeve to catch
				the blood flow from his nose. The sounds of the men muttering and
				kicking up dust faded as they moved toward the road. He exhaled heavily
				through pursed lips, disgusted.
			</p>
			<p id="page-content">
				Shams broke the silence. “Should’na done that for me.”
			</p>
			<p id="page-content">
				Hal rose to his feet with a hoarse laugh. “For you? I just wanted to
				break Jer’s nose.” He nonchalantly wiped his sleeve across his face.
				Upon closer inspection, Shams seemed fine beyond some bruises and a few
				scrapes, but those aged shoulders sagged heavily. They climbed back into
				the cart and, with a flick of the reins, drove forward.
			</p>
			<p id="page-content">“Boss won't stand for this,” Shams said.</p>
			<p id="page-content">
				“Hmm.” Hal closed his eyes. The blood splashed across his lips glued his
				mouth shut.
